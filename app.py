Welcome! This lesson helps you **see, understand, and apply** the Bernoulli principle and its mathematical underpinnings.

---

### üìò The Principle:
The **Bernoulli principle** is a fundamental concept in fluid dynamics which states that as the speed of a fluid increases, the pressure within the fluid decreases.

Think of a river: in a narrow section, the water flows faster and the pressure is lower. In a wide section, the water flows slower and the pressure is higher. This simple relationship explains everything from why airplanes fly to how a carburetor works.

---

### üéØ Objective:
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Define and explain the Bernoulli principle
- Identify real-life examples of the principle in action
- Understand the inverse relationship between fluid speed and pressure
- Relate these concepts to Common Core math standards
