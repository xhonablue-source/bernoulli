CORE FUNCTIONALITY

* User Interface (UI): The app must be a Streamlit application.
* Topic: The central theme is Bernoulli's Principle and its connection to Common Core Math.
* Target Audience: The program is for a general user, not tied to any specific school or organization.

CONTENT AND STRUCTURE

* Page Setup: Set up the page with a relevant title and icon.
* Title and Intro: Use a neutral title and an introduction that explains Bernoulli's Principle simply.
* Learning Objectives: Clearly state the learning goals for the user.
* Common Core Alignment: Explicitly state the connection to Common Core standards (e.g., HSA-CED.A.1, HSF-IF.B.4).
* User Input: Allow users to input their name and choose an avatar.
* Interactive Visualization: Include an interactive plot that shows the inverse relationship between fluid speed and pressure.
* Simplified Math Model: Present a simplified mathematical expression to represent the relationship shown in the visualization.
* Quizzes: Implement a section with quick quizzes to check user understanding.
* Reflection: A text area for users to reflect on the concepts and provide their own examples.
* Summary: A concluding section that summarizes key takeaways.
* External Resources: Provide a curated list of categorized learning resources (e.g., videos, interactive tools).
* Study Plan Generator: An interactive section that generates a personalized study plan based on user input.

TECHNICAL DETAILS

* Language: Python
* Libraries: streamlit, matplotlib, numpy.
* Code: The entire program should be a single, self-contained Python script.
* Branding: All specific branding (e.g., "Panther Vision," "Englewood STEM HS") must be removed.
* Notation: Use LaTeX for mathematical and scientific notations where appropriate.
